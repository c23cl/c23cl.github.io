		<h1>Welcome to My  Journal!</h1>
		<h2>Entry #1: Building My Website</h2>
			<p>I started by building a simple web page with a menu bar on the top for different pages within the website. I haven't expanded a lot, I just wanted to create spaces on my website.</p>
		<h2>Entry #2: Deciding On A Project Idea</h2>
			<p>I just wanted to build a small project because I just want to have something on my website. An idea I have is a translator where you type in your message and it converts it to sign language. One way this could work is that it shows you the sign language in picture. I might start with just the alphabet for now.</p>
		<h2>Entry #3: Another Project</h2>
			<p>I also had another idea which is that there is a button that says "click here!", and when you press the button, it shows you a picture of a puppy or a gif. Another idea is to make a project that says, "Which puppy are you?" and when you click the button saying show me the puppy, it puts up a picture of a puppy. Most puppy are cute, but a couple are ugly, and a couple are doing something stupid or funny.</p>
